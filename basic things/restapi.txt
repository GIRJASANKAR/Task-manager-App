now we are going to create express based rest api 
data storage
sighning up for a new account
mongoose is a really popular liberary
data validation
user login

//benifits of mongoose

// defining which feilds are important and which are opctional
// types of data for ex.i want only boolean not string
// user authentication if no.1 user added a task no34 can't acces to it or read it 

// a model is  allows us to model something in the real world that we want to be able to store 
in the database.

//object document mapper

so we create models for all the collection we want and then we use model to 
describe the data.

task manager api

// two very important topics....
 data validation and data sanitization

validation--> we can enforce that the data confirms some rules.. for example age>=18

sanitization-->allows us to alter the data before saving it


//you will know in future how to parse errors so u know what went wrong...

//mongoose does not have many validation but it is allow us to setup custom validation using our own function

but for coomplex validation like email phone number etc we use liberary
i.e, npm validator.


setting up releationships between users and tasks

// start building out the  http endpoint for task application

 first structuring our http endpoint for task api

 //resource creation... i.e, creating new users and creating new tasks
 npm i nodemon --save-dev ==>dev dependency
